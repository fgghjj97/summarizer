# Summarizer

Welcome to my Summarizer project. I created this project as an introduction to Natural Language Processing using Python's nltk library. This application aimes to create a summary from a given text/article/journal/story through keyword idetification. The project is still in progress but is built with the HTML5, Bootstrap and Python.

Feel free to browse the code and check out the page.
